TODO:

0:  class << self
      alias_method :[], :load
    end

1:  wrappable:
    - investigate using the singleton_class or alias_method instead of prepend
    - prefer instance over class mixins (see above?)
    - write more readable tests

2:  object.this { ... }

3:  const_missing require hook
    
4:  dino_catalog
    - global:       switch to activesupport concerns

5:  data_science
    - refactor to introspect on file information for instantation klasses.
      - OR inject importer into parser prior to passing off to calculator
    - omit Importer::read() in favor of Importer::load()
    - fix begin/rescue syntax in SplitTest execute
    - just use keys in build_groups in SplitTest
    - extra reject clause from init_tester in SplitTest
    - remove #to_f from denominator in conversion in SplitTest
    - SplitTestCalculator -> Calculator
    - Object.this(&block) OR GROUP_BY in SplitTestParser
    - specs -> me -> better naming
    - specs -> lets for outside context variable assignment
    - hash_matcher / keys for in 'exposes correct fields' in SplitTestCalculator
    - new line are `it` blocks
    - "populates `results` hash with accurate data" -> extract `expected`
